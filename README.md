# Zifo Python Training and Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to the Zifo Python training documentation and guidelines for programmers!  

The internet is abundant with resources for learning the Python programming langauge, but it can often be overwhelming to understand where to start and what direciton to take given your career and objectives.

In this repository you will find a roadmap for building different Python programming expertise. For each topic we will direct you to a free resource that has been verified by our Python programming team as well as optional paid resources that provide benefits like certifications.

For each resource you will find the following icons to help you decide which resource is best for you:

:gift_heart: Free resource \
:moneybag: Paid resource \
:closed_book: Book/Article/Documentation \
:movie_camera: Video \
:computer: Interactive 

We will try to limit the resources to those that we feel are most appropriate and delivers to best return on investment. When we provide more than one resource recommendation, it is because they are different formats that may suit different learning styles. You do not need to complete all the resources, just pick the one that you feel is best for you.

You will find that some resources overlap with each other and therefore the completion of one may contribute to knowledge acquired for multiple stages of your Python training.

Separate to the training material, you will find a guide on how you should setup Python on your local machine and manage projects for Zifo related work. See `Python_Setup.md` document for details. If you are unfamiliar with concepts such as git, github, and the command line interface, we recommend completing some of the tutorials in the [1.2 Must-know developer skills](#12-must-know-developer-skills) section first.

## Roadmap

The roadmap below gives a high level overview of the stages recommended in our training guidelines.

![roadmap](images/Roadmap.jpg)

Within each stage of the Python training roadmap there are options as to what technologies to learn. We recommend that you focus on one option to begin with and return to additional material at the end of the roadmap.

## 1 The Basics

The resources in this section are recommended as a minimal requirement for anyone that will be using Python. 

[1.1 Basic Syntax](#11-basic-syntax) \
[1.2 Must-know developer skills](#12-must-know-developer-skills)

### 1.1 Basic Syntax

The python ecosystem can sometimes confuse newcomers because of the existance of multiple versions of the language. The most recent version of Python is 3.11.0, but some older projects still use Python 2.7. Python 2.7 is no longer supported and will not be covered in this guide.

Although there are many different versions of Python 3, the syntax has not changed significantly between versions, but many of the libraries have. For this reason, we recommend that you use Python 3.9 or greater for all of your projects.

When learning the basic syntax however, do not be too concerned over the version of Python you are using. The syntax is very similar between versions and you can always upgrade your version later.

:gift_heart: :movie_camera: [Freecodecamp - Python for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-programming-course/)

:computer: [Freecodecamp - Python for Everybody](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/); only the _Python for Everybody_ section is required for basic syntax, however, this section also contains a lot of other useful material that covers more advanced topics.

### 1.2 Must-know developer skills

These are the skills that you should have independent of Python programming knowledge that are important to use Python professionally. If you are unfamiliar with any of these concepts, we recommend that you complete the tutorials before you start learning any advanced concepts.

[1.2.1 Git and version control](#121-git-and-version-control) \
[1.2.2 Basic command line knowledge](#122-basic-command-line-knowledge) \
[1.2.3 Using IDEs](#123-using-ides) \
[1.2.4 Basic SQL](#124-basic-sql)

#### 1.2.1 Git and version control

:gift_heart: :movie_camera: [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://youtu.be/Uszj_k0DGsg )

#### 1.2.2 Basic command line knowledge

:gift_heart: :closed_book: [How to Use the Command Line Interface â€“ for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-cli-beginner-guide/); recommended reading for all beginners

:gift_heart: :movie_camera: [Terminal commands you must know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV-ven_rxhw)

#### 1.2.3 Using IDEs

For most developers we recommend either Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or PyCharm. Whereas VSCode is free, PyCharm has a limited community edition but requires a paid license for the professional version.

:gift_heart: :closed_book: [Python development with VSCode](https://realpython.com/python-development-visual-studio-code/)

#### 1.2.4 Basic SQL

SQL or "Structured Query Language" is a language used to interact with relational databases. Although you will not need to know SQL to use Python, it is a useful skill to have and will be required for some of the more advanced topics in this guide.

:gift_heart: :computer: [Learn SQL: SQL Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.programiz.com/sql)

#### 1.2.5 Python package managers and virtual environments

Python has two main package managers, pip and conda. Pip is the default package manager for Python and is used to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). Conda is a package manager that is used to install packages from the Anaconda repository. Conda is also used to manage virtual environments and install packages from other repositories such as Bioconda.

A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python environments for them. This is useful because it allows you to work on multiple projects with different dependencies at the same time without having to worry about breaking your other projects.

There are also more advanced package managers such as poetry, pipenv and hatch, which provide additional functionality and environment management. See the `Python_Setup.md` file in this repository for more information on how you should manage your python environments.

If you are new to Python, we recommend that as a mimimum you familarise yourself with venv and conda.

### 2.1 Data structures and Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms are the building blocks of computer science. They are the fundamental concepts that are used to solve problems in the real world. In this section, we will cover some of the most common concepts that are applicable not just to Python but all software development.

### 2.2 Object-oriented programming

Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means that it supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. In this section, we will link to resources that cover some of the most common OOP concepts that are applicable not just to Python but all software development.

### 2.3 Comprehensions, Itertools, and Generators

Although Python is an object-oriented programming language, it also supports functional programming concepts such as comprehensions (If you're wondering what we mean by object-oriented programming and functional programming, and the differences between them, checkout this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-functional-programming-and-object-oriented-programming/)). In this section, we will link to resources that cover these concepts.

## 3 Testing and quality control
 
When you write production ready Python code, you should always write tests for your code. This is because tests are a great way to ensure that your code is working as expected. In this section, we will link to resources that cover some of the most common testing and quality control concepts.

There are a few different tools that can be used to write tests in Python and to quality check your code. We recommend using PyTest and a few specific tools for quality assurance, and will link to resources that cover these tools.
