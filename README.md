# Zifo Python Training and Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to the Zifo Python training documentation and guidelines for programmers!  

The internet is abundant with resources for learning the Python programming langauge, but it can often be overwhelming to understand where to start and what direciton to take given your career and objectives.

In this repository you will find a roadmap for building different Python programming expertise. For each topic we will direct you to a free resource that has been verified by our Python programming team as well as optional paid resources that provide benefits like certifications.

Separate to the training material, you will find a guide on how you should setup Python on your local machine and manage projects for Zifo related work. See `Python_Setup.md` document for details. If you are unfamiliar with concepts such as git, github, and the command line interface, we recommend completing some of the
