# Zifo Python Training and Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to the Zifo Python training documentation and guidelines for programmers!  

The internet is abundant with resources for learning the Python programming langauge, but it can often be overwhelming to understand where to start and what direciton to take given your career and objectives.

In this repository you will find a roadmap for building different Python programming expertise. For each topic we will direct you to a free resource that has been verified by our Python programming team as well as optional paid resources that provide benefits like certifications.

For each resource you will find the following icons to help you decide which resource is best for you:

:gift_heart: Free resource \
:moneybag: Paid resource \
:closed_book: Book/Article/Documentation \
:movie_camera: Video \
:computer: Interactive 

We will try to limit the resources to those that we feel are most appropriate and delivers to best return on investment. When we provide more than one resource recommendation, it is because they are different formats that may suit different learning styles. You do not need to complete all the resources, just pick the one that you feel is best for you.

You will find that some resources overlap with each other and therefore the completion of one may contribute to knowledge acquired for multiple stages of your Python training.

Separate to the training material, you will find a guide on how you should setup Python on your local machine and manage projects for Zifo related work. See `Python_Setup.md` document for details. If you are unfamiliar with concepts such as git, github, and the command line interface, we recommend completing some of the tutorials in the [1.2 Must-know developer skills](#12-must-know-developer-skills) section first.

# Minimal required training

## 1 The Basics

The resources in this section are recommended as a minimal requirement for anyone that will be using Python. 

[1.1 Basic Syntax](#11-basic-syntax) \
[1.2 Must-know developer skills](#12-must-know-developer-skills)

### 1.1 Basic Syntax

The python ecosystem can sometimes confuse newcomers because of the existance of multiple versions of the language. The most recent version of Python is 3.11.0, but some older projects still use Python 2.7. Python 2.7 is no longer supported and will not be covered in this guide.

Although there are many different versions of Python 3, the syntax has not changed significantly between versions, but many of the libraries have. For this reason, we recommend that you use Python 3.9 or greater for all of your projects.

When learning the basic syntax however, do not be too concerned over the version of Python you are using. The syntax is very similar between versions and you can always upgrade your version later.

:gift_heart: :movie_camera: [Freecodecamp - Python for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-programming-course/)

:computer: [Freecodecamp - Python for Everybody](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/); only the _Python for Everybody_ section is required for basic syntax, however, this resource also contains a lot of other useful material that covers more advanced topics.

### 1.2 Must-know developer skills

These are the skills that you should have independent of Python programming knowledge that are important to use Python professionally. If you are unfamiliar with any of these concepts, we recommend that you complete the tutorials before you start learning any advanced concepts.

[1.2.1 Git and version control](#121-git-and-version-control) \
[1.2.2 Basic command line knowledge](#122-basic-command-line-knowledge) \
[1.2.3 Using IDEs](#123-using-ides) \
[1.2.4 Basic SQL](#124-basic-sql)

#### 1.2.1 Git and version control

:gift_heart: :computer: [Learn SQL: SQL Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.programiz.com/sql)

#### 1.2.5 Python package managers and virtual environments

Python has two main package managers, pip and conda. Pip is the default package manager for Python and is used to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). Conda is a package manager that is used to install packages from the Anaconda repository. Conda is also used to manage virtual environments and install packages from other repositories such as Bioconda.

A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python environments for them. This is useful because it allows you to work on multiple projects with different dependencies at the same time without having to worry about breaking your other projects.

There are also more advanced package managers such as poetry, pipenv and hatch, which provide additional functionality and environment management. See the `Python_Setup.md` file in this repository for more information on how you should manage your python environments.

If you are new to Python, we recommend that as a mimimum you familarise yourself with venv and conda.

# Advanced optional training

Congratulations on completing the core Python sections and mandatory content! In this section, we will link to resources that cover some of the most common advanced Python concepts. These are not mandatory for all Python developers at Zifo, but are highly recommended for those who are interested in learning more about Python.

You can choose from the following topics:

* Web development frameworks - useful for those who want to build web applications
* Databases - useful for web developers and data scientists alike
* Data Science and Machine Learning - useful for data scientists and machine learning engineers
* Other advanced topics - useful for all Python developers
* Advanced Biomedical Python Programming - useful for bioinformaticians and biomedical engineers

## 4 Web development frameworks

There are many different web development frameworks that can be used to build web applications in Python. Here we will cover resources for the most popular frameworks. It is best to focus on one framework to begin with, and then move on to others once you have a good understanding of web development in Python. If you are new to web development, we recommend starting with Flask or FastAPI.

**Note** - python is typically used for the backend of web applications, and Javascript is typically used for the frontend. The resources here will focus on Python, but should you require resources for learning Javascript and frontend development, we recommend starting with the [Front End Development Library certification on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/). You should then investigate resources for full-stack development with Python.

[4.1 Flask](#41-flask) \
[4.2 Django](#42-django) \
[4.3 FastAPI](#43-fastapi) \
[4.4 Testing with Selenium](#44-testing-with-selenium)

### 4.1 Flask

Flask is a lightweight and flexible web development framework that is very popular in the Python community. Compared to Django, Flask is much simpler and easier to learn, but requires more work to set up and configure.

## 5 Databases

Databases are used to store and manage data. There are many different types of databases, and each type is best suited to a different use case. In this section, we will cover the most common types of databases, and provide resources for learning how to use them in Python.

[5.1 SQLite](#51-sqlite) \
[5.2 Relational databases with SQLAlchemy](#52-relational-databases-with-sqlalchemy) \
[5.3 Document databases wtih PyMongo and Mongoengine](#53-document-databases-wtih-pymongo-and-mongoengine) \
[5.4 Graph databases with Neo4j](#54-graph-databases-with-neo4j)

### 5.1 SQLite

SQLite is a lightweight and easy to use database that is built into Python. It is ideal for small projects and prototyping, but is not suitable for large-scale applications.

:gift_heart: :closed_book: [SQLAlchemy Documenation Tutorial](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/tutorial.html)

### 5.3 Document databases wtih PyMongo and Mongoengine

MongoDB is a popular document database that is used to store and manage data in JSON-like documents. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means that it does not use SQL to query data.

In Python, we can use PyMongo to connect to and query MongoDB databases. PyMongo is a low-level library that is very flexible, but requires a lot of work to set up and configure. For this reason, we recommend using Mongoengine instead. Mongoengine is a high-level library that is built on top of PyMongo, and provides a more convenient and intuitive interface for working with MongoDB.
